    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      RunWrapped is designed with privacy as a core principle. All processing
      happens locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit your
      personal data to any servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Health Data</h2>
    <p>
      RunWrapped reads running workout data from Apple Health with your explicit
      permission. This data is used solely to generate a run recap video on your
      device. Health data is never uploaded, stored remotely, or shared with
      third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Photos</h2>
    <p>
      If you choose to add a photo to your video, the image is accessed locally
      and used only for rendering. Photos are never uploaded or shared
      externally by RunWrapped.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      RunWrapped does not collect analytics, tracking data, personal
      identifiers, or usage metrics. We do not use third-party analytics or
      advertising SDKs.
